<p className=\"resume--text\">\n                        I am 21 years old, currently living in Utah. I have taken to web development\n                        like wildfire. I started learning how to code in November of 2015. After 2\n                        months of struggling to find good resources that kept my attention I decided\n                        to attend a coding bootcamp. It was a 4 month course and when I was done I\n                        was able to build a fully functional site.Not long after I landed my first\n                        job in Salt Lake City.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <p className=\"resume--text\">\n                        At this job I focused on mainly the backend but I also took on the\n                        task&#39;s of front end work. After 6 months working for this company things\n                        went down hill. Sadly the company hit a hard time and had to lay me off. It\n                        was a hard time but I kept my head up and decided to make the best of it.\n                        Now I am freelancing and learning react as I think its a awesome
